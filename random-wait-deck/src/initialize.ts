/*
  This is a contrived example of how to use an `initialize` function to hook into arbitrary Deck services. 
  This `initialize` function provides the help field text for the `RandomWaitStageConfig` stage form.

  You can hook into any service exported by the `@spinnaker/core` NPM module, e.g.:
   - CloudProviderRegistry
   - DeploymentStrategyRegistry

  When you use a registry, you are diving into Deck's implementation to add functionality. 
  These registries and their methods may change without warning.
